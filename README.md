# TASBoard
GUI for creating input displays from TAS movie files

## Building From Source
TASBoard used the following NuGet packages:
- SharpZipLib 1.3.3
- FFMediaToolkit 4.1.2
  - You will also need to follow the setup instructions [here](https://github.com/radek-k/FFMediaToolkit#setup). I will make a more relevant abbreviated version of this later.
